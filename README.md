# Course Syllabus: Machine Learning Algorithms

**Instructor:** Anthony Mauro
**Course Number:** CSE-90160

## Course Description

This course covers a large volume of material, requiring students to keep up with the pacing. The machine learning algorithms covered are selected to provide a foundational base of knowledge for success in subsequent courses.  Topics include Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Dimension Reduction, along with their Python implementations.

## Textbook

*   "Python and Math Essentials for Machine Learning - A Beginner's Guide"
    *   [https://store.bookbaby.com/book/python-and-math-essentials-for-machine-learning](https://store.bookbaby.com/book/python-and-math-essentials-for-machine-learning)

## Course Prerequisites

"Python and Mathematics for Machine Learning" is a prerequisite. Students should be comfortable with the Python development environment and introductory statistics, linear algebra, and calculus.

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

*   Create Python programming language scripts in the Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebooks development environment to pre-process a dataset using standard Machine Learning libraries.
*   Implement and analyze regression models including simple and multiple regression, polynomial, lasso, and logistic regression.
*   Implement and analyze "supervised" classification algorithms including, but not limited to, Naive Bayes and K nearest neighbors (KNN).
*   Implement and analyze "unsupervised" clustering algorithms including, but not limited to, K-means and density-based spatial (DBSCAN) clustering.
*   Implement and analyze dimensionality reduction techniques including linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
*   Write and test working Python programs from a generic problem statement through algorithm development, design and implementation, unit test, integration, and final test.

## Course Materials

Lecture materials/videos will be posted in each session of the course on Canvas.  Students are expected to review these materials prior to each course session.
